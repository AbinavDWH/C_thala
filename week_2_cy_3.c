/*
Imagine Anu is tasked with finding the middle element of a doubly linked list. Given a doubly linked list where each node contains an integer value and is inserted at the end, implement a program to find the middle element of the list. If the number of nodes is even, return the middle element pair.
Input format :

The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of nodes in the doubly linked list.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in the doubly linked list.
Output format :

The first line of output prints the space-separated elements of the doubly linked list.

The second line prints the middle element(s) of the doubly linked list, depending on whether the number of nodes is odd or even.


Refer to the sample outputs for the formatting specifications.
Code constraints :

In the given scenario, the test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 15

1 ≤ values of the list ≤ 100
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

5
10 20 30 40 50

Output 1 :

10 20 30 40 50 
30

Input 2 :

8
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

Output 2 :

5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 
20 25
